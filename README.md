Authored by Benjamin N. Sulman and Jean Philippe Gibert

The repository contains two directories:

The Mathematica directory contains the notebook used for the population models. File Sulman_Gibert_Global_Carbon_Models.nb is a Mathematica notebook file and needs to be downloaded and open in Mathematica for it to load and run properly.

The CORPSE-Pred directory contains python code and driver datasets for the quantitative global modeling portion of the manuscript.

Note that the python code was run using python version 3.5.5 and uses the following packages:

* xarray version 0.10.9
* numpy version 1.15.2
* scipy version 1.1.0
